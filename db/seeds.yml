    - title: 'Leather Bike U-Lock Holster'
      description: |
        Finally a convenient and stylish way to carry your u-lock on your bicycle!
        Inspired by Brooks saddles, I designed this holster after searching for months for a stylish, non-plastic way to carry my u-lock on my bike rather than in my bag, and refined the design on my bike commutes to ensure it stays put in a rattle-free way.
        The u-lock holster has been featured on The Awesomer, Gear Culture, and Biped Fred.
        Super-strong stitching keeps your lock tightly secured and rattle-free.
        Hand-finished, hand-stitched thick leather holster attaches to your bike in two places on your front or rear rack using Chicago screws and a buckle closure.
        It requires a flathead screwdriver to mount.
        This u-lock holster is designed to fit the Kryptonite Evolution Mini-Evo 5 u-lock (or any lock with exterior dimensions approximately 5.5" wide crossbar x 7.25" long). U-lock companies include the inside dimensions of their u-locks in their specs rather than the outside (they measure the "hole" in the middle rather than the dimensions of the lock itself) - the Mini-5 is 5.5 x 7.25 on the outside and 3.25 x 5.5 on the inside.

      description: |
        Do you love riding your bike? What about plants? Bring your plants on an adventure and let them enjoy some sunshine and fresh air! If you’ve ever dreamed about attaching a plant to your bike, now you’re in luck! This bike planter is made using 3D printing technology, so not only will you be showing off your love of nature, but you’ll be participating in a little piece of the future.
        This bike planter is created digitally with modeling software. It is then 3d printed out of nylon, hand dyed teal, and sealed with a UV protective varnish to protect the color. Due to the hand dying process, the color of this planter may vary slightly. This planter works best with a clipping from a succulent that has been allowed to take root or a large air plant.
        This planter attaches firmly to your bike with an elastic nylon cord, and will fit snugly on most tube sizes. You’ll have to supply your own plant and bicycle to make your next adventure fully amazing!
        Measures 2.3” tall, 1.4” wide, and 1” deep. This listing is for a teal bike planter with a yellow elastic cord. Directions for use are included with the planter. This item ships domestically via USPS Priority Mail, and internationally by USPS first class mail. This item is made to order, and takes about 2 weeks to ship. If you would like to use a different shipping method for this item, please contact me before ordering to arrange.      price: 35

    - title: 'wooden bike hook, minimal and simple'
      description: |
        These minimal wooden bike hooks are made for light sports bikes that you want to store indoors. I tried to create a very simple but good looking bike storage solution which works in my home. The beautiful and natural oak wood makes these hooks appear like a peace of high quality furniture.
        This pair comes in plain oak wood and will be shipped in a beautiful white box. The box includes a pair of wooden bike hooks, two shelf supports with dowels as shown in the last picture and assembly instructions.
        Mounting:
        Prerequisite for using the bike hooks is the perfect assembly and a stable wall.
        The two included dowels can be used in some but not all walls.
        Check your wall and use dowels that work with it.
        The dowels need to be seated straight and firmly into the wall as a prerequisite to screw the shelf support straight and tight into the dowel against the wall. If the shelf support is mounted you can put the wooden bike hooks over the shelf support with both hands.
        The bike hooks are made for light sports bikes that you want to store indoors and may not work with heavier bicycles.

    - title: 'Bike Beer Growler Holder Cover Carrier'
      description: |
        Leather beer growler carrier for your bicycle.
        So you need to make a trip to your local brewery to fill your beer growler with your favorite craft brew to go enjoy at home, the park, a party, wherever. What better way to make that trip than on your bike and what better way to carry that beer growler than with a hand crafted, classy, stylish leather beer growler holder fixed securely to your bike. This growler holder looks so good that I often attract attention and get compliments from people who don't even know what a beer growler is, and when I tell them what it is they like it even more.
        This holder is sturdy and durable, I just "tested" it on a recent trip from Seattle to San Francisco. It came with me and my bike riding down the coast in the sun, rain and fog. (The first image is actually from half way through the trip and as you can see still looks beautiful after 500 long miles on the road.) Stopping at nearly every brewery along the west coast that we passed it held up remarkably. My riding friend and I were a hit when we showed up at each hiker biker site with a full growler of the local micro brew of the day.
        Hand crafted with as much care as the wonderful craft beer that fills your beer growler. Great for transporting your home brew in style or standing out and looking classy when you take that growler to be filled at your local brewery. This growler cover will attract attention and protect your growler at the same time.

    - title: 'City Handle Bars'
      description: |
        Old-fashioned sew-on leather grips for your city bicycle handlebars.
        Leather is functional and tactile, and it wears beautifully the more it is handled (and it's fine in the rain!).
        It gets grippier when wet, and more beautiful with age as the oils in your hand give it a nice patina.
        The leather is made with vegetable-tanned leather I finish with a combination process including Walnut Studiolo's weatherproofing dressing.
        The leather pictured here is dark brown.
        Pre-punched stitching guides along the sides, and comes with choice of white, tan, dark brown, or black waxed thread stitching kit.

    - title: 'Bike Basket - Large walnutwood bike basket'
      description: |
        I was recently comisioned to make a bike basket that would be larger then normal, sturdy, lightweight and still have the warm aesthetic of wood. This basket is the result of that request and has reinforced my enjoyment of custom orders.
        It measure 21" long x 15" wide x 10" high and can easily accomodate most shoulder bags, purses, and finds at the vintage store or farmers markets.
        The curved laminations create a light weight structure that is strong enough to handle daily use. Furthermore, a weatherproof epoxy and a durale oil finish help it to weather the elements.
        It is made out of solid Black Walnut and a durable plywood base. If you prefer, you may have your basket made out maple, white oak, or cherry.
        Please feel free to convo me with any questions or requests

        This vintage metal bicycle frame is a fun table top home accessory. It's a nice statement piece sitting out on your coffee table, or just as fun tucked onto a shelf. We updated the paint job in a bright orange. Fresh and airy, it adds some decorative pop without the bulk.
        The wooden seat is in the shape of a heart. And, the original paint job was rusted, so the metal frame has some textured spots here and there. Just adds to the rustic history of the piece.

      description: |
        This beautiful top hat from the 20-30's is made of a silk grosgrain fabric. It is in excellent condition and found stored in the Dobb's hat box in another listing of mine when given to me. It was my Aunt's Father in law's...probably the first of his top hat's. He had several. It was purchased at Croll & Keck, dealers in men's hat's and clothing since the early 20's in Reading, PA.
        This hat shows no sign of wear at all. It is for a men's size 7. It's shape is like the beaver fur hat I've listed as it has a brim that is arched and curved toward the sides and flat near the front and back. The hat is trimmed and piped at the brim edge in black grosgrain ribbon. The top of the hat is slightly curved outward, giving it an especially elegant look to it. In the research I've been doing, I've not seen an all grosgrain fabric top hat. It's quite wonderful!

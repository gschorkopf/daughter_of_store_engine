    - title: 'Leather Bike U-Lock Holster'
      description: |
        Finally a convenient and stylish way to carry your u-lock on your bicycle!
        Inspired by Brooks saddles, I designed this holster after searching for months for a stylish, non-plastic way to carry my u-lock on my bike rather than in my bag, and refined the design on my bike commutes to ensure it stays put in a rattle-free way.
        The u-lock holster has been featured on The Awesomer, Gear Culture, and Biped Fred.
        Super-strong stitching keeps your lock tightly secured and rattle-free.
        Hand-finished, hand-stitched thick leather holster attaches to your bike in two places on your front or rear rack using Chicago screws and a buckle closure.
        It requires a flathead screwdriver to mount.
        This u-lock holster is designed to fit the Kryptonite Evolution Mini-Evo 5 u-lock (or any lock with exterior dimensions approximately 5.5" wide crossbar x 7.25" long). U-lock companies include the inside dimensions of their u-locks in their specs rather than the outside (they measure the "hole" in the middle rather than the dimensions of the lock itself) - the Mini-5 is 5.5 x 7.25 on the outside and 3.25 x 5.5 on the inside.

      description: |
        Do you love riding your bike? What about plants? Bring your plants on an adventure and let them enjoy some sunshine and fresh air! If you’ve ever dreamed about attaching a plant to your bike, now you’re in luck! This bike planter is made using 3D printing technology, so not only will you be showing off your love of nature, but you’ll be participating in a little piece of the future.
        This bike planter is created digitally with modeling software. It is then 3d printed out of nylon, hand dyed teal, and sealed with a UV protective varnish to protect the color. Due to the hand dying process, the color of this planter may vary slightly. This planter works best with a clipping from a succulent that has been allowed to take root or a large air plant.
        This planter attaches firmly to your bike with an elastic nylon cord, and will fit snugly on most tube sizes. You’ll have to supply your own plant and bicycle to make your next adventure fully amazing!
        Measures 2.3” tall, 1.4” wide, and 1” deep. This listing is for a teal bike planter with a yellow elastic cord. Directions for use are included with the planter. This item ships domestically via USPS Priority Mail, and internationally by USPS first class mail. This item is made to order, and takes about 2 weeks to ship. If you would like to use a different shipping method for this item, please contact me before ordering to arrange.      price: 35

    - title: "Excellent Condition Men's Black Grosgrain Silk Top Hat"
      description: |
        This beautiful top hat from the 20-30's is made of a silk grosgrain fabric. It is in excellent condition and found stored in the Dobb's hat box in another listing of mine when given to me. It was my Aunt's Father in law's...probably the first of his top hat's. He had several. It was purchased at Croll & Keck, dealers in men's hat's and clothing since the early 20's in Reading, PA.
        This hat shows no sign of wear at all. It is for a men's size 7. It's shape is like the beaver fur hat I've listed as it has a brim that is arched and curved toward the sides and flat near the front and back. The hat is trimmed and piped at the brim edge in black grosgrain ribbon. The top of the hat is slightly curved outward, giving it an especially elegant look to it. In the research I've been doing, I've not seen an all grosgrain fabric top hat. It's quite wonderful!
